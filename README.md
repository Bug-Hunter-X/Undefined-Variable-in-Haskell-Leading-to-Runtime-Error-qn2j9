This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell caused by using the `undefined` value.  The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version. The error occurs because the program tries to perform arithmetic operations on an undefined value, which results in a runtime exception.  This is a crucial concept in Haskell because of its lazy evaluation strategy. This example highlights the importance of ensuring all variables are properly defined and initialized before use. Using pattern matching and explicit checks for potential undefined values is a common solution.
